Probably the best-known of all South American composers, Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887 – 1959) was 
influenced by both Brazilian folk music and the European classical tradition. <!--more--> Uninterested in a formal musical 
education, Villa-Lobos taught himself cello and guitar, and set out to explore the Amazon. 

Here's a cover of Britney Spears' Toxic I put together with Shannon Ferguson. For more videos, see Shannon's

Inspired by [Twitch Plays Pokemon][twitch], Ostracon was a library for real-time voting
over the internet. It used Erlang's lightweight actor model so that each connection could be represented with a single actor.
After a certain time period, a reduce function would take all the values and compute some arbitrary aggregated value
that can be used in application logic.

We built a couple of examples to demonstrate the library, starting with a pie chart that could resize in a live demo
where each participant could join a vote every second.

We decided to also use the library to build a simple distributed game where players vote to control a professor
in a quest to get grant money.

For our final graphics project, [Jayme Woogerd][jayme] and I implemented a
configurable particle system in C using OpenGL buffer 
objects, instancing, and GLSL shaders.

We started by using fixed-pipeline OpenGL, rendering each particle as a point.
Most of the parameters are configurable, including the number of 
particles generated, the randomness spread, camera direction, 
and location of particle generation, and the physical forces.

</div>

We then added vertex buffer objects and instancing. Instancing 
allows us to define a single two-dimensional template billboard, 
shared by all particles. This 2-dimensional image is 
rotated to always face the camera - giving the illusion 
that the particles are 3-dimensional, while keeping the 
rendering fast.

</div>           
               
Attributes that are unique to a given particle (such as size, 
color, position and age) are stored and sent to the GPU via 
buffer objects.

</div>          

 Finally, we used the GL shader language to implement different
                texture maps and animations.

In its 2016 "Visions of Future Shipping" [paper][wartsila-visions], [Wärtsilä][wartsila] proposed ideas that could change the way
that shipping companies operate in the future. One of the most novel ideas was ships traveling in convoy. 
[Researchers at MIT][mit-study] explain that "like birds and fighter jets flying in formation, or bikers 
and race car drivers drafting in packs, vehicles experience less aerodynamic drag when they drive close together."

For the 2017 Ports and Logistics [Hackathon][hackathon], we set about to take create a platform for helping
ships to form convoys for 10 - 20% in improved fuel efficiency. <!--more--> Aside from the fuel efficiency gains, 
traveling in convoys also allows ships to share resources like medical supplies rather than make expensive detours.

The following visualization, created by [Kiln][kiln] and the [UCL Energy Institute][ucl], shows the global movement of 
ships in 2012.

To allow these ships to become convoys, we created [Converge]. The target market is small shipping companies that could 
collaborate with each other to compete with the [giant, more fuel-efficient ships][maersk-eee] 
of their goliath competitors. Based on the data shown above and other ship lane data, we chose 5 of the highest-traffic 
routes for the first version of the product.

Each dot represents a convoy of ships traveling along one of the routes.

In December of 2016, I recorded this original composition for [Versace Eyewear][versace-eyewear] with the unstoppable flamenco guitarist,
[Jackson Scott][jackson]. It was used in Versace's Spring 2017 campaign.

Jackson and I met at a jam while he was visiting NYC, and he had a vision for adding cello to a commercial spot he was
working on. We spent a couple of sessions improvising together and went into the studio.

I had done a few studio recordings before, but this was my first advertising gig. I really wasn't sure what to expect. 
As it turned out, fitting all the music we had thought about into a one minute commercial spot was totally impossible. 
We ended up just improvising something brand new in the studio.

At [Phosphorus][phosphorus], my focus was building software to analyze genetic sequencing data. I can't share any of the 
code I developed there, but I can share the process behind something I made: the logo.

Here's where it began. I was trying to convey Phosphorus' place on the periodic table (the atomic number 15), and the 
fact that we were doing genetic tests (hence the DNA double helix).


<div style="text-align: center;">
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-square.png" description="v1" style="height: 150px;" wrapperstyle="display: inline-block;" %}
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-original.png" description="v2" style="height: 150px;" wrapperstyle="display: inline-block;" %}
</div>

Since then, the design evolved. The colors became brighter, and the lines connect to only one side.

<div style="text-align: center;">
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-new.png" description="v3" style="height: 150px;" %}
</div>

It looks pretty cool on the [website][phosphorus], but my favorite spot I've seen the logo I made is on a cupcake.
