In December of 2016, I recorded this original composition for [Versace Eyewear][versace-eyewear] with the unstoppable flamenco guitarist,
[Jackson Scott][jackson]. It was used in Versace's Spring 2017 campaign.

Jackson and I met at a jam while he was visiting NYC, and he had a vision for adding cello to a commercial spot he was
working on. We spent a couple of sessions improvising together and went into the studio.

I had done a few studio recordings before, but this was my first advertising gig. I really wasn't sure what to expect. 
As it turned out, fitting all the music we had thought about into a one minute commercial spot was totally impossible. 
We ended up just improvising something brand new in the studio.
