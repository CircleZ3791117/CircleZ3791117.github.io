先来一封外企CEO发的邮件：
> Happy New Year -  I hope you and your family had a great holiday and enjoyed some well-deserved time off. Thank you again for a terrific effort and a strong result last year!

再来一封老美写的开发客户的邮件：
> Hello Steven. It was my pleasure to talk with you earlier today - thank you for contacting XXXX. I am writing to share more information with you about XXXX and our digital signage system. The attached corporate brochure will provide you with an overview of our most popular system features - you can learn more by visiting our website at XXXX.com. As you will see, XXX has been providing industry-leading digital signage systems for the past 25 years and we are honored to have our systems in place with over 2,500 hotels, resorts and casions around the world. We would be very interested in exploring a relationship with XXXX in order to explore digital signage opportunities in China. As I've mentioned, our primary focus is with hotels, resorts and casinos. Our digital display systems are designed to meet the needs of the hospitality market. We are fortunate to have earned preferred-vendor status with many of the leading hotel brands including: Hyatt, Hilton, Sheraton, Westin, Marriott, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Renaissance and many more. Please let me know if you have any relationships with any hotels and we can develop a plan to pursue the opportunity together. Please review our information at your earliest convenience and let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to our next communications. Regards, xxxx.

# 一、基本邮件礼仪（Email etiquette）

## 1) 感谢
中文邮件不喜欢太多客套话，但是美国人写邮件，哪怕是和熟悉的人，回邮件第一句话都要感谢，所以他们的邮件都是thank来thank去的。

开头，感谢别人回复自己的邮件（也可以用thank you，用在稍微正式场合，比如和陌生人发邮件）

- Thanks for the quick reply.
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- Thanks for the update on the situation.
- Thanks for the updated information.
- Thanks for gathering the information this week on this issue.

别人发邮件提供信息给你，中文邮件是懒得回的，英文邮件也习惯感谢，简单回复一个。
- Thank you.
- Well noted.
- Noted/Received with thanks.
- Good information.

## 2) 道歉
如果是邮件回得晚了，先道歉，貌似中文很少有这个习惯（一下sorry也可以替换成apologize, 更正式一点，发给重要的人或者群发）
- Sorry for the late reply.
- Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.
- Sorry for the delay getting back to you.

如果是临时通知别人是什么事情
- Apologies for the late/short notice.

如果上一封邮件没写清楚导致收件人误解了
- I apologize if this was not made clear

提前给别人预警如果措辞过于强硬
- I apologize if this may make you uncomfortable/bad.
- I apologize if this may sound a little harsh.

## 3) 收尾套路
最后收尾的套路，一般都是问别人意下如何。
- Please let me know what you think.
- Please let me know your thoughts.
- Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.(最常见)
- Please let me know if there are questions.
- Looking forward to your input/insight.(用insight/input代替opinion) 
- That's my idea, what's your idea? (也有直接这样说的)
- Please review the lengthy e-mail and provide feedback on how we can proceed.(如果邮件太长了)

或者干脆下面的结语：
- I'll let you know more tomorrow.(表示今天没说完， 明天再说更多)
- Please call me if you like.(有什么事打我电话)

## 4) 称呼
普通工作邮件直接称呼名字就好，比如 Hi Steven, 不需要用Mr.，甚至写给总裁的邮件，也是直说Hi Bill, 不需要Hi President Johnson。**否则看起来很不自然。**

只有德国人是个例外，喜欢加Mr./Ms. 德资企业发给女性的邮件居然要称呼Ms. Zhang

学术场合才需要加抬头，比如Prof. Johnson。政客的Congressman Johnson。

记住，一般不加Dear，只有公司的群发邮件才会说Dear all.

## 5）告别邮件主题
离职时发邮件感谢同事，一般用以下两种
- Thank you
- Farewell

# 二、邮件基本术语
尽量不要凭想象力创造一些表达
## 1）抄送别人
美国人直接说copy
- I have put John on copy.(记住put on copy的固定搭配)
- You can copy Steven going forward.
