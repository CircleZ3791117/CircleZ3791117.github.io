> 写一封地道的，能准确表情达意的英文邮件在日常工作中还是很重要的，本文就记录一些常用的英文邮件表达。

先来一封外企CEO发的邮件：
> Happy New Year -  I hope you and your family had a great holiday and enjoyed some well-deserved time off. Thank you again for a terrific effort and a strong result last year!

再来一封老美写的开发客户的邮件：
> Hello Steven. It was my pleasure to talk with you earlier today - thank you for contacting XXXX. I am writing to share more information with you about XXXX and our digital signage system. The attached corporate brochure will provide you with an overview of our most popular system features - you can learn more by visiting our website at XXXX.com. As you will see, XXX has been providing industry-leading digital signage systems for the past 25 years and we are honored to have our systems in place with over 2,500 hotels, resorts and casions around the world. We would be very interested in exploring a relationship with XXXX in order to explore digital signage opportunities in China. As I've mentioned, our primary focus is with hotels, resorts and casinos. Our digital display systems are designed to meet the needs of the hospitality market. We are fortunate to have earned preferred-vendor status with many of the leading hotel brands including: Hyatt, Hilton, Sheraton, Westin, Marriott, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Renaissance and many more. Please let me know if you have any relationships with any hotels and we can develop a plan to pursue the opportunity together. Please review our information at your earliest convenience and let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to our next communications. Regards, xxxx.

# 一、基本邮件礼仪（Email etiquette）

## 1) 感谢
中文邮件不喜欢太多客套话，但是美国人写邮件，哪怕是和熟悉的人，回邮件第一句话都要感谢，所以他们的邮件都是thank来thank去的。

开头，感谢别人回复自己的邮件（也可以用thank you，用在稍微正式场合，比如和陌生人发邮件）

- Thanks for the quick reply.
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- Thanks for the update on the situation.
- Thanks for the updated information.
- Thanks for gathering the information this week on this issue.

别人发邮件提供信息给你，中文邮件是懒得回的，英文邮件也习惯感谢，简单回复一个。
- Thank you.
- Well noted.
- Noted/Received with thanks.
- Good information.

## 2) 道歉
如果是邮件回得晚了，先道歉，貌似中文很少有这个习惯（一下sorry也可以替换成apologize, 更正式一点，发给重要的人或者群发）
- Sorry for the late reply.
- Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.
- Sorry for the delay getting back to you.

如果是临时通知别人是什么事情
- Apologies for the late/short notice.

如果上一封邮件没写清楚导致收件人误解了
- I apologize if this was not made clear

提前给别人预警如果措辞过于强硬
- I apologize if this may make you uncomfortable/bad.
- I apologize if this may sound a little harsh.

## 3) 收尾套路
最后收尾的套路，一般都是问别人意下如何。
- Please let me know what you think.
- Please let me know your thoughts.
- Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.(最常见)
- Please let me know if there are questions.
- Looking forward to your input/insight.(用insight/input代替opinion) 
- That's my idea, what's your idea? (也有直接这样说的)
- Please review the lengthy e-mail and provide feedback on how we can proceed.(如果邮件太长了)

或者干脆下面的结语：
- I'll let you know more tomorrow.(表示今天没说完， 明天再说更多)
- Please call me if you like.(有什么事打我电话)

## 4) 称呼
普通工作邮件直接称呼名字就好，比如 Hi Steven, 不需要用Mr.，甚至写给总裁的邮件，也是直说Hi Bill, 不需要Hi President Johnson。**否则看起来很不自然。**

只有德国人是个例外，喜欢加Mr./Ms. 德资企业发给女性的邮件居然要称呼Ms. Zhang

学术场合才需要加抬头，比如Prof. Johnson。政客的Congressman Johnson。

记住，一般不加Dear，只有公司的群发邮件才会说Dear all.

## 5）告别邮件主题
离职时发邮件感谢同事，一般用以下两种
- Thank you
- Farewell

# 二、邮件基本术语
尽量不要凭想象力创造一些表达
## 1）抄送别人
美国人直接说copy
- I have put John on copy.(记住put on copy的固定搭配)
- You can copy Steven going forward.

如果是分别抄送给某些人，但又不想让他们知道互相的联系方式，可以用暗送（BCC，也就是blind cc），比如同事发给几个供应商，邮件开头直接写
> BCC vendors

## 2）群发邮件添加联系人
一般开头无称呼，直接说
- Looping in Steven.
- Adding/Added Steven.

甚至直接用“+”都可以
- \+ Steven

把某人删除(涉及到保密信息)，用remove
- Removed Mike from this email

## 3) 转发邮件怎么说
> forward the email to someone
> pass me the email

## 4）回复邮件怎么说
get back 比 reply 常用
> I will get back to you tomorrow.

## 5) 附件怎么说
附件的英文是attachment，但是一般不会说please find the attachment。
一般直接用attached，enclosed。
> Attached/Enclosed please find the report.
> I attached the report and let me know what you think.

## 6）文件怎么说
excel,pdf,word的正确说法document，而不是file.(excel也可以说spreadsheet，PPT也可以说presentation)
> Attached please find the document.

# 三、和陌生人发邮件如何自我介绍
不要用 This is xxx 和 I am ，开头也不要太多客套话，外国人开头都是直接说 My name is XXX
> 	Hi Mike,
> 		My name is Steven Gates. I work in the R&D department and am in charge of ...

# 四、群发邮件如何称呼
这种句式，实际上，只有群发给整个公司，比如公司新闻之类的才用这种称呼，其他时候用下面的句式：
- Team，（最常用）
- Gents，（如果全部是男的）

# 五、邮件里插话怎么说
本来你只是在cc列表里作为旁观者，但是你也想进来插一句怎么说？ 使用 chime in
- Just to chime in, xxx
- I'd like to chime in with my idea, xxx

如果邀请别人发表意见，用 please chime in here with your thoughts/comments/idea.

> Steven, please chime in here with correct information

# 六、邮件如何更礼貌
使用tentative语气，字面上的意思就是【试探性】的语气，也就是不要把话说死，给自己留一点余地。
**注意tentative不等于uncertain的语气，要和maybe这种语气区分开来**
**比如多用seem，appear，sound，look这样的词**

> 例如:
> This is wrong 改成 This seems to be wrong.
> We don't have other option 改成 It seems we don't have other option.

也就是在下结论时记得加一个seems，appears，语气没那么生硬。

另外描述一个东西，就算明显已经知道很好，也要说looks good，sounds good，而不是It's good.

以下还要注意几点：
## 1）不用总说maybe，如果确定性比较大的情况下，用probably（或者用seem）

比较

例一：
> Maybe this is right. (×)
> This is probably right. (✔️)

例二：
> Could we have a better way to do it?
> Maybe. (×)
> Probably. (✔️)

很多人滥用maybe，不管什么情况下都用maybe，给人一种毫无把握的感觉。
如果想表示“我很可能是错的”用 I'm probably wrong.

## 2）给别人提供建议时，不要用should,而是用It would be better

比较

> This designed should be changed
> It would be better if we can change the design

## 3）表示一件事希望你做，但是不强求时，用 It would be nice/great 而不是 I need you to xxx, I hope you xxx, could you?

比较

> I hope you can come today.
> You need to come today.
> Could you come today?
> It would be nice/great if you can come today. (隐含意思是 still OK if you can't make it)

## 4) 问别人要东西/信息时，用May I have...? 而不要 Could you give me?

比较

例一：
> What's your name?
> May I have your name?

例二：
> Could you send me the drawing today?
> May I have the drawing today?

例三：
> Could you give the letter?
> May I have the letter?

例四(问别人有没有时间)：
> Could I have a moment/minute of your time?（非常非常礼貌，销售员问法）
> Do you have a moment/minute?（一般礼貌，同事朋友之间问法）

例五(比如想打个私人电话，要别人回避一下)：
> Could you come out?
> Could I have a moment(for myself)?

## 5) 问别人是否可以做一件事，用Is it possible that... 比 Could you 更礼貌

比较

例一：
> Could you change the design?
> Is it possibel for you to chang the design?

例二：
> Could you call me tomorrow?
> Is it possible for you to call me tomorrow?

## 6) 请别人帮忙做一件事，在前面加(by) any chance,意思是如果有时间/有机会，很委婉

> By any chance, could you help me check the data?

## 7) 指责别人时，用现在进行时比一般现在时更委婉

比较

> You are impatient/argumentative/unreasonable. 你很没耐心/强词夺理/无理取闹
> You are being imapatient/argumentative/unreasonable

用前面的说法一个are就把别人说死了，正常的说法是用being，这样表示某事某刻这个人处于某种状态

## 8) 表达要求时多用进行时

比较

> We need to do this as soon as possible.
> We need to be doing this as soon as possible.

## 9) 用would like 代替 want
want稍微带有要求的意思，用would like更委婉一些
> I want to have a meeting with you.
> I'd like to have a meeting with you.

## 10) 用过去时表示一种委婉语气
口语中经常用过去式表示一种委婉语气，比如 I wanted, I thought, I was thinking, I was wondering, I was hoping. 

## 11) 慎用please
please 有时稍微带有一点命令语气，特别是在给客户或者老板写邮件请求某事，把please替换成疑问句。

比较

例一：
> Please reply to me by today.
> Could you reply to me by today?

而以下情况用please就没有问题，因为有let me
> Please let me know your feedback.

## 12) 用let, allow更礼貌

比较

例一：
> Please tell me your feedback.
> Please let me know your feedback.

例二：
> I want to make a propasal.
> Please allow me to make a proposal.

## 13) 不要不分场合的用screw,suck这些非正式用语。
> If your screw this up, you will not have a second chance.

## 14) 由于客观上做不到，not able to 代替 can not

比较

> Sorry I can't come to the party today since I'll need to work very late.
> Sorry I'm not able to come to the party today since I'll need to work very late.

## 15) 给need加将来时，更加委婉

比较

> You need to buy a new machine if this one doesn't work.
> You'll need to buy a new machine if this one doesn't work.

## 16) 美国人喜欢用 I guess 来代替 I think

比价

例一：
> I think we'll leave now.
> I guess we'll leave now.
例二：
> I think we can do better.
> I guess we can do better.

## 17) 用 I'm good 代替 no
美国人一般用 I'm good 来委婉拒绝。
> Would you care for some coffee?
> I'm good. Thank you.

## 18) 指责别人用 You're better than that
指出别人错误时，一般不用 You're wrong/careless/weak，一般用 You're better than that，这是非常礼貌的说法。

## 19）某些负面情况下用 have difficulty 代替 can't，委婉把责任推向自己这边

比较

例一：
> I can't trust you.
> I have difficulty trusting you.

例二：
> I don't understand your question.
> I have difficulty understanding your question.

## 20) 委婉命令别人用 It might be a good idea 比 please 要礼貌
> It might be a good idea to fasten your seat belt.
