Probably the best-known of all South American composers, Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887 – 1959) was 
influenced by both Brazilian folk music and the European classical tradition. <!--more--> Uninterested in a formal musical 
education, Villa-Lobos taught himself cello and guitar, and set out to explore the Amazon. 

He later moved to New York, but never forgot his Brazilian musical roots. Villa-Lobos named his work Assobio a Jato ("The Jet Whistle")
to describe the unorthodox technique the flutist must use in the last movement: blowing with the mouth fully covering 
the mouthpiece. 

Flutist Meredith Packer asked me to join her in playing this piece for a recital in 2013.
